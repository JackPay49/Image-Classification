# Image-Classification
An experiment on image classification using CNNs &amp; CIFAR100.

This experiment was conducted as part of coursework for the UoM course unit COMP34212: Cognitive Robotics. This experiment includes a short analysis of the state-of-the-art in robotic vision, followed by a thorough set of experiments. This project aimed at improving the metrics towards image classification using the complex dataset of CIFAR100. Overall a test accuracy and loss of 61.130% and 1.977 were achieved using a CNN with Residual connections and multi-head attention.
